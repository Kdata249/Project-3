## Ethical_Considerations
    In our project we all made an effort to be guided by ethical considerations in regards to the data and the code we wrote. 
    We made sure to pull the data we had from an open source, with no conflicts in regards to legal, privacy, or other ethical concerns. 
    While we are using synthetic data in our project, it was treated like real data, and all patients are anonymous, only referenced by a random ID. 
    Using a new coding language for this project, a lot of research went into the syntax and commands to use; all code that we used or were inspired by was pulled from the data sources listed above.
